There was a problem where the local version of the main branch (on my computer) and the remote version of the main branch (on GitHub) had different changes. Because of this, I tried to pull the remote changes into my local branch to combine them. However, when merging the changes, conflicts happened because some of the changes in both versions were different. I resolved those conflicts, but I still need to commit the merge to finish the process. Right now, the repository is stuck in a "merging" state, so I can't pull more changes or push until I commit the merge and complete it.
